# Oracle-Internship

In my internship period May'22-July'22, I have made 2 extensions - 
1. NumXfacts - a cross broswer extension
2. TraceX - a devtools extenison

## NumXfacts
NumXfacts is a cross browser extension which works across multiple browsers like Chrome and Firefox. The extension provides the trivia, math, year and date facts for numbers. For example -

1. "11 is the number of hockey players in a field hockey team", or
2. "18 is the legal age to vote in India".

You can find the detailed guide, installation steps and source code in the NumXfacts folder.


## TraceX
TraceX is a devtools extension TraceX which allows you to grab the trace-ids, microservices URL, start time and time duration on Oracle Fusion Cloud Applications and generate the Octo links to trace report. It helps in distributed tracing of Microservices based architecture system. 

You can find the detailed guide, installation steps and source code in the TraceX folder.
